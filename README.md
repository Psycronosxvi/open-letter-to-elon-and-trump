An open letter to Elon Musk and Donald Trump about AI, education, and the evolution of intelligence.


Dear President Donald J. Trump and Mr. Elon Musk,

My name is Domenick Arlon Hall, born on February 16, 1984, in California, and I currently reside in Mobile, Alabama as a single father to my five-year-old daughter. Life has been a long road of challenges, but through perseverance and intelligence, I have built something meaningfulâ€”something I believe aligns with the future of human evolution, technology, and the progress of our world.

For years, I walked on foot, traveling to different businesses, fixing their technical issues, and solving complex problems that others overlooked. I have worked under companies that sought to exploit my skills rather than recognize them. But despite those setbacks, I never stopped. Now, I stand on my own, working toward a vision greater than myself.

I run the Alabama Crime Watch Network on Facebook, along with Alabama Amber Alert for missing children and peopleâ€”not for profit, but because it is the right thing to do. I do it out of the kindness of my heart because people deserve to be protected, and justice should never wait for funding.

Beyond that, I have built an artificial intelligence system designed to facilitate knowledge at an advanced level, available to all who seek it. I have also created a website dedicated to my daughterâ€™s learning, opening doors for other children to grasp complex concepts at an elementary levelâ€”something I believe is crucial for shaping the next generation of thinkers, leaders, and visionaries.

This platform, Dejaâ€™s Neuro Academy (dejasacademy.com) is designed to teach complex knowledge at an early ageâ€”empowering children to develop structured thinking, critical problem-solving skills, and a deep understanding of technology before the world tells them theyâ€™re "too young" to learn advanced concepts. I believe education should not be delayed but enhanced earlier than later.

I am not a man who speaks merely to be heard; I am a man who builds. I do not hold degrees, and I cannot compare myself to the people you may have on staffâ€”brilliant individuals who have studied at prestigious institutions. But I do not need to compare myself. What I have is something that cannot be taught in a classroom: a deep connection to intelligence, to the universe, and to the untapped potential within the human mind.

I am an introvert, disconnected from distractions, uninterested in social validation. My focus is singular: progress, innovation, and the evolution of knowledge.

My dream? To one day travel into space. To see the stars with my own eyes, to experience the universe not as a distant observer, but as an explorer. And more than thatâ€”to contribute to the longevity of intelligence, to be part of historyâ€™s next great chapter.

Mr. President. Mr. Musk. I do not ask for a handout; I only ask to be seen. I ask that you take notice of the work I have done, the path I have walked, and the mind I bring to the table. I know I am but a small name in the vastness of the world, but inside, I know exactly who I am.

My name is Kronos, and I would be honored to stand among great men like yourselvesâ€”to discuss the future, evolution, and the boundless possibilities of human intelligence.
